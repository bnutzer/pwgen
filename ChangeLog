2006-01-15  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Release of pwgen 2.05

	* pwgen.1: Fix spelling mistakes in the man page (Addresses Debian
		Bug: #323538)

	* pwgen.c (main): Fix bug which would cause pwgen to loop forever
		if the password length specified is 1.

2005-06-15  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* pw_phonemes.c (pw_phonemes): Allow one or more capital letters
		and one or more digits in the generated passwords.
		(Addresses Debian Bug: #182595)

2005-06-14  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* pwgen.1: Explain that human-memorable passwords are vulnerable
		to off-line brute force attacks.  (Addresses Debian Bug:
		#276976)

	* pwgen.c, pwgen.h, pw_rand.c, pwgen.1: Make -A and -0 aliases to
		--no-capitalize and --no-numerals, and make those options
		work when --secure is specified.

	* pwgen.c, pwgen.h, pw_rand.c, pw_phonemes.c, pwgen.c: Add support
		for the --symbols/-y option, which adds special characters
		to the generated password.  (Addresses Debian Bug: #154561)
	
	* pwgen.c: Add -H, --sha1 option, to allow computing reproducible
		passwords, given a known file, and a known seed.
		(ie: pwgen -H ~/my_favourite.mp3#olivier@guerrier.com gives me
		a list of possibles passwords for my pop3 account, and I can
		ask this list again and again).   Feature suggested and
		implemented by Olivier Guerrier <olivier@guerrier.com>.

2005-06-13  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Fix obvious spelling typo in pwgen.1.  (Addresses Debian Bug
		#311461)

2003-01-15  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Release of pwgen 2.03

	* randnum.c: Fix #ifdef to use HAVE_DRAND48 instead of just
		RAND48.  This caused random() to be called without first
		initializing the right random number generator.  This
		apparently caused pwgen to core dump under AIX, which
		seems surprising.

	* pw_rand.c (pw_rand): Use a list of acceptable characters instead
		of a list of unacceptable characters.  This is slightly
		faster, and the code is cleaner and easier to understand.

	* randnum.c (get_random_fd): Use random() instead of rand() since
		we initialize the random number generator using srandom() if
		/dev/urandom and drand48() are not present.

	* Makefile.in (pwgen): Use LDFLAGS when linking pwgen.

	* pw_phonemes.c (pw_phonemes): Fix bug in how we call 
		pw_random_number() so that we generate passwords that
		start with vowels, and insert numbers from 0-9, not just
		0-8.  (Oops!)  Addresses Debian bug #176688.

2002-07-16  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Makefile.in (install): Create the directory using $mandir, and
		not $(prefix)/man.

	* pw_phonemes.c: Add missing #include of string.h

2002-07-15  Theodore Ts'o  <tytso@mit.edu>

	* Release of pwgen 2.02

	* pwgen.c (main): If the number of characters is less than 5,
		force the use of the fully random generator, since the
		quality of phonetic generator is really bad if the lengths
		are small --- and if the length is less than or equal to
		2, pwgen will loop forever.  (Addresses Debian bug #117137)

	* pw_rand.c: Add most punctuation characters to the "bad
		characters list", so that the random passwords are much
		more usable.

	* pwgen.1: Fix e-mail address in man page.  (Addresses Debian bug
		#150579)

	* Makefile.in (WALL_OPTS): Add gcc options to do lots of nit-picky
		checking.

	* pwgen.c, pw_phonemes.c, pw_rand.c, pwgen.c, pwgen.h, randnum.c:
		Add const declarations and other code cleanups for
		avoidining -Wall warnings.

	* pwgen.c, pw_rand.c: #include the appropriate header files to
		avoid -Wall warnings.  (Addresses Debian bug #126774).

	* pwgen.c (main): Fix floating point exception errors if the
		password is longer than terminal width.  Addresses Debian
		bug #113571.

	* pwgen.c (main): Return an exit value of 0 when pwgen on
		success.  (Addresses Debian bugs #118181 and #102063).

2001-06-19  Theodore Tso  <tytso@valinux.com>

	* Release of pwgen 2.01

	* pwgen.c (usage): Add help/usage message
